# linked-lists

**What this is?**

A linked list is a dynamic data structure where each of the elements points to the following element. This can be contrasted with an array where the elements are given a physical place in memory. This program is an implementation of a linked list in Ruby by using 
class instances as pointers to build a linked list.

**Functionality of the program**

 - Able to append elements to the beginning and end of a linked list
 - Able to return any of the Node's in the linked list by giving the program an 'index' to pull from.
 - Able to remove elements from the end of the list. 
 - Able to print out the values of the linked list with a pretty structure
 - Other linked list searching functionality such as: Checking if the list contains a specific value,
   finding a specific value and checking what node exists at a certain 'index'.

**What I have learned**

 - Improved my understanding of classes and class instances and interactions between two seperate classes.
 - Improved my understanding of Ruby's garbage collection
